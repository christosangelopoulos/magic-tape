## How to install Ueberzug

 The [ueberzug](https://github.com/seebye/ueberzug) project has been archived. However, in order to install `ueberzug` one can follow these steps:

- Install dependencies

```
sudo apt install libx11-dev libxres-dev libxext-dev
```
If during the installation process, errors appear due to absence of other depedencies, the user is encouraged to search the error message in the internet in order to locate the misssing dependency.

- Follow the install instructions found in [this ueberzug fork](https://github.com/gokberkgunes/ueberzug-tabbed):

```
git clone "https://github.com/gokberkgunes/ueberzug-tabbed.git"

cd ueberzug-tabbed

python -m pip install .

```

**NOTE**: One may need to call above `pip install` commands as `pip install --break-system-packages` to successfully install the packages.

---

---

To install these `magic-tape.sh `dependencies, run the following command:

```
sudo apt install curl fzf mpv jq xclip
```

To install `rofi`:

```
sudo apt install rofi
```

To install `dmenu`:

```
sudo apt install dmenu
```

## Note for macOS users

macOS has an outdated version of Bash (v3). You need to install the latest bash version using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install bash
```

Then install GNU utils used by the script (`echo`, `sed`, `head`, `tail`):

```sh
brew install gnu-sed coreutils

# Add this to your shellrc (.basrc, .zshrc, ...)
# Adapt to the location of your homebrew installation path.
export HOMEBREW_PREFIX=/opt/homebrew
export PATH="$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
```

Finally install the remaining dependencies:

```sh
brew install curl fzf mpv jq yt-dlp
```

---

## Install

Clone the `magic-tape` repo, and then get to the `magic-tape/` directory:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/christosangel/magic-tape.git
```
```
cd magic-tape/
```
Make `install.sh` executable, then run it:

```
chmod +x install.sh&&./install.sh
```
That's it, the script is now installed.

---

## Run

To run the script from the same directory, run:

```
./magic-tape.sh
```

or from any directory, provided that `~/.local/bin/` is added to the $PATH:

```
magic-tape.sh
```

---

---


## Configuring

Through the `P Option` in the `Miscellaneous Menu`,  the user can configure many pamaters of this script. The same can be equally well achieved by editing the `~/.config/magic-tape/magic-tape.conf`file, outside the script  :

## Updating `yt-dlp`

With a hit of a key (__option Y__ in the Miscellaneous Menu), the user can __update `yt-dlp` command__, and keep using it (and magic-tape) without any hiccups:

![update_yt-dlp.png](screenshots/update_yt-dlp.png){height=320}

__NOTICE: Updating `yt-dlp` with this option works only when `yt-dlp` has been installed using pip__.

---

## Subscribing to a new channel

Selecting the __n option__ of the Miscellaneous Menu, the user can subscribe to a new channel.

Initially, the user is asked to enter a keyword / keyphrase to search channels with.

Channel selection then is made with __fzf__:

![image 13](screenshots/fzf2.png){height=320}

* In the __n & u options__ of the Miscellaneous Menu (subcribe/unsubscribe to a channel), after a selection, the user will be asked to sync the changes manually to their YouTube account.

---

---


## Viewing Video Description & Comments

Provided that the `COMMENTS_TOGGLE` variable is configured to `yes` in  `~/.config/magic-tape/magic-tape.conf` file (default `yes`), the video description as well as the comments written by YT viewers will be shown in the terminal window, while the video is reproduced.

![image 14](screenshots/comments.png){height=300}
![image 15](screenshots/comments1.png){height=300}
![image 16](screenshots/comments2.png){height=300}

Thus, the user can be satisfied reading other viewers having a swing at the politicians/celebrities/stars they love to hate, or, watch closely to their heart's content, as cyber nuclear attacks are launched between self-righteous, valiant and livid keyboard fighters.

The user can configure comments number, replies number and sorting, through three more variables in `~/.config/magic-tape/magic-tape.conf`file.

The user is also able to show pinned comments (if any) as first or last in the comment section.

Pinned comments will be marked accordingly and will be printed in different color to the other comments, in order to stand out.

Comment loading is asynchronous to video loading, so it is possible that there will be some delay in the appearence of the comments. That depends on the number of comments, network speed etc.

Also, it would be helpful to mention enabling __limitless scrolling__ through your terminal emulator's preferences, in order not to miss a post in video with many many comments.

---

## `zsh` Compatibility

If the user runs the script with `zsh`, the `$SHELL` will be automatically exported to `/bin/bash`. If any compatibility problrms arise, create an issue.

---

---

## Troubleshooting

The ___vast majority___ of the issues mentioned, had only to do with:

### A. Improper installation of the script.

If the user does't install properly the script, the script will not function. Proper installation is very easy,  just one line command in the terminal.

### B.  Out of date `yt-dlp` command.

In my experience, the best way to keep the _driving force_ of this script, that is `yt-dlp` __up-to-date__, one might:

- preferably __install it with `pip`__:

```
pip install yt-dlp
```

- Check regularly for updates, and __update easily__ with one command:

```
python3 -m pip install -U "yt-dlp[default]"
```

- To make things easier, just hit __Y__ and select __Update yt-dlp__ option from within the __Miscellaneous Menu__.




### C. Browser not logged-in causes problems.

`yt-dlp` uses browser cookies to function properly. So, Before opening magic-tape, make sure that you log in to yt in your browser, and the right values arre assigned to `PREF_BROWSER` and `LINK_BROWSER` in the config file.


If the user takes notice of these few points, chances are the experience with magic-tape  will be  at least satisfactory.

__Enjoy!__
